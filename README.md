# calc_microcontroller_power_usage

This website allows you to easily calculate the power usage of your microcontroller in days and the power scale of your choice solar module.

## Features
Two tabs to switch between microcontroller and solar module calculations.

### Microcontroller Tab:
Calculate the power usage of the microcontroller based on its work mAh, deep sleep mAh, working time, interval, and accumulator capacity.

### Solar Module Tab:
Calculate the power scale of the solar module based on the middle sun hours, max sun hours, voltage, and capacity (mAh).


## Usage
Open the website in a web browser.
Choose the appropriate tab for the calculation you want to perform: "Microcontroller" or "Solar Module."
Fill in the required input fields with the relevant values.
Click the "Submit" button to calculate the results.
The calculated results will be displayed in the corresponding result section below the form.
